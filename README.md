## Abstract
dfsdf
* Generally, defense tools (intrusion detection and anti-virus) focus on the vulnerable component of risk. This kind of tools also relies on the fact that an intrusion is successful
* There is now a new type of threat nammed "Advanced Persistent Threat" (APT). In this category, we have some adversaries that are well-resourced and trained. They conduct intrusion campaigns during years and which affect sensitive economic or national security information. To achieve their goals, they use advanced tools and techniques that bypass conventional security methodologies
